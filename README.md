Marymount Programming Snippets
======================
This is a collection of the various programming homework and classwork assignments I have coded for the following classes at Marymount University:

* IT 130 - Introduction to Java Programming (Fall 2011)
* IT 230 - Advanced Java Programming (Spring 2013)
* IT 320 - Structures of Programming Languages (Fall 2013)

The following is a description of each snippet:
* areas.pl: a looped program which can calculate the areas of a circle, square, triangle, rectangle, parallelogram, ellipse, and trapezoid (Prolog)
* CountFamilies.java: a program that takes into account the number of families, records each family's salary in an array, and calculates the highest income of the families
* hw1.lex: a LEX file that shows the data definition for the parsing program in hw1.y
* hw1.y: a Bison file that checks the syntax of a proper for, do while, and while loop (pseudocode)
* hw2.sml: a program which can calculate the areas of a circle, square, triangle, rectangle, parallelogram, ellipse, and trapezoid (ML) 
* hw4.cpp: a program which can calculate the areas of a circle, square, triangle, rectangle, parallelogram, ellipse, and trapezoid (C++) 
* OrderException.java: a program snippet that throws an exception in PizzaOrder5.java when a person orders more than 5 pizzas (Java)
* PizzaOrder5.java: a program that records pizza up to 5 pizza orders and places them into a text file (Java)
* pizza.cpp: a program that calculates pizza prices in a loop based on a pizza size and quantity (C++)
* PriceException.java: a program snippet that throws an exception in PizzaOrder5.java when a person presses order but does not make any selection (Java)
* washingtontree.pl: a program that can determine the relationship between any two or three persons within the George Washington family tree (Prolog)
